  # ==== Arguments
  # * +expected_score+: a float between 0 and 1, representing the probability of
  # the player winning
  # * +actual_score+: 0, 0.5, or 1, whether the outcome was a loss, draw, or win
  # (respectively)
  # * +rating+ (optional): the rating of the player, used by the K-factor function
  # * +k_factor+ (optional): the K-factor to use for this calculation to be used
  # instead of the normal K-factor or K-factor function
  #
  # Returns a positive or negative float representing the amount the player's
  # rating should change.
